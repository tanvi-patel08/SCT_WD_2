I’m excited to share Task 2 of my internship at Skillcraft Technologies, where I developed an interactive stopwatch web application with a strong focus on functionality, user experience, and clean frontend implementation.

✨ Key Features Implemented:
• Start, pause, and reset stopwatch functionality
• Real-time time tracking with smooth updates
• User-friendly and responsive interface
• Clean and minimal UI for better usability
• Interactive controls designed for seamless user experience

🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
• HTML5 – structure and layout
• CSS3 – styling and responsive design
• JavaScript – stopwatch logic, event handling, and time calculations

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript timing functions, DOM manipulation, and frontend best practices, while reinforcing the importance of building efficient and user-centric web applications.

Looking forward to applying these skills in upcoming tasks and projects! 🚀
